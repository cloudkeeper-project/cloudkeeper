\chapter{Type System} \label{sec:TypeSystem}

An out-port is \emph{type-compatible} with an in-port if one of the following criteria holds:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the out-port type and in-port type are the same
	\item there is an implicit conversion rule from the out-port type to the in-port type
	\item one of the previous two conditions holds, and data parallelism can be inferred from the edge.
\end{itemize}
