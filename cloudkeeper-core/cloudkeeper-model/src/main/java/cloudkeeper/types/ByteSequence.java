/**
 * Byte sequence.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this interface represent arbitrary immutable byte sequences. For technical reasons, this interface
 * keeps several properties unspecified. Implementations may implicitly or explicitly contain external references (for
 * instance, a URI to some remote storage). Therefore, it may be impossible for implementations to enforce immutability.
 * However, the effects of modifying a byte sequence or the externally referenced data are undefined, and must be
 * avoided in portable code! Since byte sequences may be of arbitrary size, this interface does not define a particular
 * behavior for {@link Object#equals(Object)} or {@link Object#hashCode()}.
 *
 * <p>The default media type is {@link #DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE}, even though classes implementing this interface may
 * have a more specific type.
 *
 * <p>All implementations of this interface are required to support CloudKeeper serialization with
 * {@link ByteSequenceMarshaler}. To this end, method {@link #getDecorator()} must provide an appropriate decorator
 * that takes a raw byte sequence and returns an appropriately typed instance of a subclass.
