/**
 * Defines interfaces for modeling elements ofs the CloudKeeper data-flow language.
 *
 * CloudKeeper elements are similar in concept to "elements" of the {@link javax.lang.model} package and its
 * subpackages. "Element" refers to the "declared entities that make up a program"; in the case of the CloudKeeper
 * data-flow programming language, this includes plugin declarations, modules, ports, etc.
 *
 * All general statements made in the documentation of the wrapper package {@link xyz.cloudkeeper.model.bare} hold
 * without restrictions for this package.
 *
 * This package is partly inspired by the corresponding package {@link javax.lang.model.element} that models elements of
 * the Java programming language.
 *
 * @see xyz.cloudkeeper.model.bare
 * @see javax.lang.model.element
